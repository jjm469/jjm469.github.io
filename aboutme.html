        <h1 class="title1">About Me</h1>
        <p class="about1">Going into college, I was not sure what I wanted to do. I have always had a fascination with technology and learning how it worked. I particularly loved working on older electronics; not only were they cheap, but I thought they were cool to have. My other engineering interests include embedded programming, cyber security, web development, robotics, and software engineering. Over the summer, I learned a bit about Kali Linux and enjoyed experimenting with its features which I would say has sparked my interest in Cybersecurity. I am now currently enrolled in an embedded systems class, and while I have some experience doing projects on my own, I am looking forward to taking a course dedicated to the topic.</p>
        <p class="about2">Regarding my non-stem-related interests, I have always loved debate and considered a potential law career. While I did decide to do my undergrad in engineering, I may go to law school to become a patent lawyer. I feel the profession perfectly blends two of my interests, but I have time to decide.</p>
