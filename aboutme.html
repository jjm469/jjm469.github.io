        <h1 class="title1">About Me</h1>
        <p class="about1">Going into college, I was not sure what I wanted to do. I have always had a fascination with technology and learning how it worked. I particularly loved working on older electronics. Not only was it cheap, but I also loved the retro aesthetic that came along with it. One of the projects on my to-do list is to put a Raspberry Pi fitted with an SSD into an Emerson portable TV which I feel would make a perfect second monitor for streaming my favorite shows. My other engineering interests include embedded programming, cyber security, web development, robotics, and software engineering. </p>
        <p class="about2">Regarding my non-stem-related interests, I have always loved debate; during my senior year of high school, I often attended my AP Government class twice for class discussions. Needless to say, I was definitely the geek of the class. All jokes aside, this love for debate made me consider a potential law career. Obviously, I decided to go with engineering, but becoming a patent lawyer is an option for me in the future. I love how it blends together two things I am passionate about, but I have time to decide what I want to do.</p>
        <p class="about3">Whichever path I choose to take, I am confident I will do well. I do not mean to come off as cocky, but I feel I have earned the right to say that. I have worked hard to get to where I am now and will continue to work hard at whatever I do.  </p>
